            <h2>3. General notes and mandatory information</h2>

            <h3>Data protection</h3>

            <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your
                personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this
                data protection declaration.</p>

            <p>When you use this website, various personal data is collected. Personal data is data that can be used to
                identify you personally. This privacy statement explains what information we collect and how we use it.
                It also explains how and for what purpose this is done. </p>

            <p>We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) may
                be subject to security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not
                possible.</p>

            <h3>Note on the responsible body</h3>

            <p>The data controller for this website is:</p>

            <p>JAC Systeme GmbH<br>
                Seestraße 4<br>
                18439 Stralsund<br>
                Germany</p>

            <p>E-Mail: info[@]jac-systeme.de<br>
                Telefon: +49 3831 306507</p>

            <p>The controller is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes
                and means of the processing of personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses, etc.).</p>

            <h3>Storage period</h3>

            <p>Unless a more specific storage period has been specified within this privacy policy, your personal data
                will remain with us until the purpose for processing the data no longer applies. If you assert a
                justified request for deletion or revoke consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we
                have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. retention periods under tax
                or commercial law); in the latter case, the data will be deleted after these reasons cease to apply.</p>

            <h3>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h3>

            <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke your consent
                at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by
                the revocation.</p>

            <h3>Right to object to the collection of data in specific cases and to direct marketing (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>

            <p>IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 ABS. 1 LIT. E OR F DSGVO, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE
                PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS
                ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS
                BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS DATA PROTECTION STATEMENT. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR
                PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE
                YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR
                DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ARTICLE 21(1) DSGVO).</p>

            <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA ARE PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT
                ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO
                APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL
                DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART.
                21 PARA. 2 DSGVO).</p>

            <h3>Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority</h3>

            <p>In the event of a breach of the GDPR, data subjects shall have the right to lodge a complaint with a
                supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of
                work or the place of the alleged breach. The right of appeal is without prejudice to any other
                administrative or judicial remedy.</p>

            <h3>Right to data portability</h3>

            <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in
                fulfilment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If
                you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done insofar as it
                is technically feasible. </p>

            <h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3>

            <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or enquiries
                that you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognise an
                encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from &quot;http://&quot;
                to &quot;https://&quot; and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>

            <p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

            <h3>Information, deletion and correction</h3>

            <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to obtain information free of
                charge at any time about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients and the purpose of the
                data processing and, if applicable, the right to correct or delete this data. You can contact us at any
                time with regard to this and other questions on the subject of personal data.</p>

            <h3>Right to restrict processing</h3>

            <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. To do this, you
                can contact us at any time. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>

            <ul>
                <li> If you dispute the accuracy of the personal data we hold about you, we will usually need time to
                    verify this. For the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the
                    processing of your personal data.
                </li>
                <li> If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the
                    restriction of data processing instead of erasure.
                </li>
                <li> If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or enforce legal
                    claims, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of
                    deletion.
                </li>
                <li> If you have lodged an objection in accordance with Art. 21 (1) of the GDPR, a balance must be
                    struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests
                    prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, such data may - apart from being stored -
                only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the
                protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest
                of the European Union or a Member State.</p>

            <h2>4. Data collection on this website</h2>

            <h3>Server log files</h3>

            <p>The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files,
                which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li> Browser type and version</li>
                <li> Operating system used</li>
                <li> Referrer URL</li>
                <li> Host name of the accessing computer</li>
                <li> Time of the server request</li>
                <li> IP address</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This data is not merged with other data sources.</p>

            <p>The collection of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The website operator has a
                legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimisation of its website - for
                this purpose, the server log files must be collected.</p>

            <h3>Request by e-mail, telephone or fax</h3>

            <p>If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your enquiry including all resulting personal data (name,
                enquiry) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We will not pass
                on this data without your consent.</p>

            <p>The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. b DSGVO, insofar as your request is related to
                the performance of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all
                other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of the
                enquiries addressed to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO) or on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO)
                if this has been requested.</p>

            <p>The data you send us via contact requests will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke
                your consent to store it or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies (e.g. after your request
                has been processed). Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory retention periods - remain
                unaffected.</p>
